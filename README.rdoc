== Welcome to Hackternoon

Hackternoon.com is a site to help Hackternooners find projects and other Hackternooners.

The upgrade from Rails 3.2.2 to Rails 3.2.3 is done.

Here is a list of enhancements I am focused on:

  - Write a cucumber test for whitelist logic in photo_url.rb
  - Add a form to projects#show-view which allows me to signal interest to the owner
  - Add a New-Project-link for guest which is a page of instructions and Register-link
