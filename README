== Welcome to Hackternoon

When I work with git and Hackternoon, I need to be aware of some facts.

I bounce development between my Mac and a Linux host called z3.

Also I need to sometimes communicate with github.com over https when I am at the library.

This is because the library blocks most internet ports.

Normally when I work on my Mac I follow this flow:
  - cd to ~/pt/nov/hn18/
  - git branch
  - git co mac
  - git pull origin_git mac
  - develop software
  - git add .
  - git commit -a -v -m commit_msg
  - git push origin_git mac

I use a naming convention for my remote-declarations:
  - origin means "use git protocol"
  - origin_git means "use git protocol"
  - origin_http means "use https protocol"

For my branches I use the mac branch on my mac and the z3 branch on my linux box.

I intend to frequently merge them on top of master.

Some syntax from my .git/config file is displayed below:

[core]
  repositoryformatversion = 0
  filemode = true
  bare = false
  ignorecase = true

[remote "origin_http"]
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  url = https://github.com/hackternoon/hackternoon.git

[remote "origin_git"]
  url = git@github.com:hackternoon/hackternoon.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

[remote "origin"]
  url = git@github.com:hackternoon/hackternoon.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

[branch "master"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master

[branch "z3"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/z3

[branch "mac"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/mac

[user]
  name = Dan Bikle
  email = dan@bot4.us

[branch]
  autosetupmerge = true
