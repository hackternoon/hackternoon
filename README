== Welcome to Hackternoon

When I work with git and Hackternoon, I need to be aware of some facts.

I bounce development between my Mac and a Linux host called z3.

Also I need to sometimes communicate with github.com over https when I am at the library.

This because the library blocks most internet ports.

Normally when I work on my Mac I follow this flow:
  - cd to ~/pt/nov/hn18/
  - git branch
  - git co mac
  - git pull origin_git mac
  - develop software
  - git add .
  - git commit -a -v -m commit_msg
  - git push origin_git mac

Some syntax from my .git/config file is displayed below:

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	ignorecase = true
[remote "origin_http"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = https://github.com/hackternoon/hackternoon.git
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master

[user]
	name = Dan Bikle
	email = dan@bot4.us
[branch]
	autosetupmerge = true

[branch "z3"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/z3


[remote "origin_git"]
	url = git@github.com:hackternoon/hackternoon.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

[branch "mac"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/mac

[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:hackternoon/hackternoon.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
