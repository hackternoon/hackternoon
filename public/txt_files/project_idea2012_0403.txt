People,

The main idea displayed on Hackternoon.com right now is that it is a site for developers to find other developers who want to do collaborative development.

I now doubt that a site for "paired-programmers" is a compelling idea.

Currently I'm thinking a lot about how to make hackternoon.com more attractive to developers who want to register projects there.

Ryan thinks the "project" idea is poor.

He might be correct but I want to hammer on it for awhile.

The project idea seems to be working well for a number of sites:

Github.com, Elance.com, Guru.com, Odesk.com, SourceForge.com, etc.

Ryan thinks I should focus more on using Hackternoon.com as a way to promote Hackternoon events.

I like that idea but I want to make it "Plan-B".

Plan-A is to push the "project" idea:

Hackternoon.com is for users who want to engage (or hire or work with) a software developer:
  - The user needs to put some personal info in his profile
  - The user needs to write up a project description of what he wants
  - The user needs to advertise the project description on the web (craigslist probably)
  - The user needs to provide value to the developer:
    - Money
    - Software services
    - Teaching services
    - "Other" services (Marketing?, Taxes?, Work-Finding?, Hardware?, Office-Space?)

Hackternoon.com is for software developers who want one or more of these things:
  - Customers
  - Students
  - Collaborative Developers
  - Fame

The developer needs to do these things:
  - Put some personal info in his profile
  - Write up project descriptions of what he has done or is doing

Secondary to the project idea is the dating-site idea.

I want each user to see attributes of other users which could be "attractive".

Here is a list of attributes which might be useful:

- Personality type
- Location
- Spoken Language
- Skill set
- Twitter Handle
- LinkedIn profile
- FB profile

Obviously hiring managers would want to see these attributes.

But also the developers would be interested seeing these attributes when studying managers or other developers.
