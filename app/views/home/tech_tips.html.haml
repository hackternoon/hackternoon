    I want to use jQuery-UI to "Accordion" my Blog Entries and Technical Tips.
    %br/
    %br/
    I bumped into an issue where my browser could not see any of the jQuery-UI functions.
    I was confused because I could see jQuery-UI as being loaded when I viewed source.
    %br/
    %br/
    I did find a good clue in the JavaScript console of my browser.
    It displayed this error:
    %br/
    %br/
    Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion'
    %br/
    %br/
    I figured out the problem by studying the order of .js files served to my browser.
    %br/
    %br/
    Short story: public/assets/application.js was over-writing other .js files loaded earlier. And it was missing the jQuery-UI library.
    %br/
    %br/
    Long story:
    %br/
    %br/
    The file public/assets/application.js is generated from this file:
    %br/
    %br/
    %a(target="b" href="https://github.com/hackternoon/hackternoon/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js")
      https://github.com/hackternoon/hackternoon/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    %br/
    %br/
    When I add a jquery-ui "directive" to app/assets/javascripts/application.js,
    I need to then run this rake command:
    %br/
    %br/
    RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake assets:precompile
    %br/
    %br/
    Normally I run the above command before I deploy my site to Heroku.
    But in this situation I needed to run it in my development environment.
    %br/
    %br/
    Why?
    %br/
    %br/
    Because it will then add jQuery-UI functions to this file:
    %br/
    %br/
    public/assets/application.js
    %br/
    %br/
    which is the very last file to get loaded 
    and thus the file which overwrites all the JS in previous files I see in the source.
    %br/
    %br/
    Moral: Ensure that your JavaScript code resides in public/assets/application.js
